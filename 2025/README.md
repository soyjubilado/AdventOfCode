## Things I learned during AoC 2025

  - Day 3: Recursion isn't always more succint.
  - Day 4: Easy isn't always clean.

## Notes On Individual Days

### Day 1

  - Nice warmup, but part 2 had a gotcha: if you move the dial more than
    the size of the dial, you'll automatically pass 0.

### Day 3

  - Fun recursion for part 2; I modified part 1 to use the same solution.

### Day 4

  - Use a grid library I wrote for previous years.


### Day 5

  - It's tempting to call your class "range." Don't do it.

### Day 6

  - Messy.
